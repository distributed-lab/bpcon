> This is a rust library implementing weighted BPCon consensus.

## Documentation

Library is documented with `rustdoc`.
Compiled documentation for `main` branch is available at [GitBook](https://distributed-lab.github.io/bpcon).

## Usage

### Add dependency in your `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
bpcon = {version = "0.1.0", git = "https://github.com/distributed-lab/bpcon"}
```

### Implement [Value](https://distributed-lab.github.io/bpcon/bpcon/value/trait.Value.html) trait

This is a core trait, which defines what type are you selecting in your consensus.
It may be the next block in blockchain, or leader for some operation, or anything else you need.

Below is a simple example, where we will operate on selection for `u64` type. 
Using it you may interpret `ID` for leader of distributed operation, for instance.

```rust
...
use bpcon::value::Value;

#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, Eq, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize, Debug, Hash)]
pub(crate) struct MyValue(u64);

impl Value for MyValue {}
```

### Implement [ValueSelector](https://distributed-lab.github.io/bpcon/bpcon/value/trait.ValueSelector.html) trait

`BPCon` allows you to define specific conditions how proposer (leader) will select value 
and how other members will verify its selection.

Here is a simple example:

```rust
...
use bpcon::value::ValueSelector;

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct MyValueSelector;

impl ValueSelector<MyValue> for MyValueSelector {
    /// Verifies if the given value `v` has been correctly selected according to the protocol rules.
    ///
    /// In this basic implementation, we'll consider a value as "correctly selected" if it matches
    /// the majority of the values in the provided `HashMap`.
    fn verify(&self, v: &MyValue, m: &HashMap<u64, Option<MyValue>>) -> bool {
        // Count how many times the value `v` appears in the `HashMap`
        let count = m.values().filter(|&val| val.as_ref() == Some(v)).count();

        // For simplicity, consider the value verified if it appears in more than half of the entries
        count > m.len() / 2
    }

    /// Selects a value based on the provided `HashMap` of party votes.
    ///
    /// This implementation selects the value that appears most frequently in the `HashMap`.
    /// If there is a tie, it selects the smallest value (as per the natural ordering of `u64`).
    fn select(&self, m: &HashMap<u64, Option<MyValue>>) -> MyValue {
        let mut frequency_map = HashMap::new();

        // Count the frequency of each value in the `HashMap`
        for value in m.values().flatten() {
            *frequency_map.entry(value).or_insert(0) += 1;
        }

        // Find the value with the highest frequency. In case of a tie, select the smallest value.
        frequency_map
            .into_iter()
            .max_by_key(|(value, count)| (*count, value.0))
            .map(|(value, _)| value.clone())
            .expect("No valid value found")
    }
}
```

### Decide on a [LeaderElector](https://distributed-lab.github.io/bpcon/bpcon/leader/trait.LeaderElector.html)

`LeaderElector` trait allows you to define specific conditions, how to select leader for consensus.

__NOTE: it is important to provide deterministic mechanism, 
because each participant will compute leader for itself 
and in case it is not deterministic, state divergence occurs.__

We also provide ready-to-use 
[DefaultLeaderElector](https://distributed-lab.github.io/bpcon/bpcon/leader/struct.DefaultLeaderElector.html)
which is using weighted randomization.

### Configure your ballot

As a next step, you need to decide on parameters for your ballot:

1. Amount of parties and their weight.
2. Threshold weight.
3. Time bounds.

Example:

```rust
use bpcon::config::BPConConfig;

let cfg = BPConConfig::with_default_timeouts(vec![1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 4);
```

Feel free to explore [config.rs](https://distributed-lab.github.io/bpcon/bpcon/config/struct.BPConConfig.html) 
for more information.

### Create parties

Having `BPConConfig`, `ValueSelector` and `LeaderElector` defined, instantiate your parties. 
Check out [new](https://distributed-lab.github.io/bpcon/bpcon/party/struct.Party.html#method.new)
method on a `Party` struct.

### Launch ballot on parties and handle messages

Each party interfaces communication with external system via channels. 
In a way, you shall propagate outgoing messages to other parties like:

1. Listen for outgoing message using `msg_out_receiver`.
2. Forward it to other parties using `msg_in_sender`.

We welcome you to check `test_end_to_end_ballot` in `party.rs` for example.
