            Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

            We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.
            Examples of valid PR titles:

            - feat: support new error codes
            - fix(config): correct env resolution
            - ci: add new workflow for linting

            Details:

            ```
            ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
            ```

      - name: Delete a comment if the issue resolved
        uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
        if: ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message == null }}
        with:
          header: pr-title-lint-error
          delete: true
